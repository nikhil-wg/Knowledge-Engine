# 🚀 BioSearch: NASA Bioscience Knowledge Engine

An AI-powered semantic search system built during the **NASA International Space Apps Challenge** that allows researchers and students to ask natural language questions and get **AI-generated answers with cited sources** from NASA bioscience publications.

🔍 Ask: *"How does microgravity affect human bone density?"*  
🧠 Get: A clear, scientific summary + references — powered by **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**.

## 🌟 Features

- **Semantic Search** – Find relevant NASA research using vector embeddings
- **AI-Powered Q&A** – Answers generated by Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Source Citations** – Every answer links back to original publications
- **Fast & Scalable** – Built with real-time backend and efficient indexing

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|------|------------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js |
| **Backend & DB** | Convex (with vector search) |
| **AI Models** | `gemini-2.0-flash`, `text-embedding-004` |
| **AI Framework** | LangChain |
| **Hosting** | Vercel (frontend), Convex (backend) |

## 📦 How It Works

1. **Ingest**: Pulls titles, abstracts, and summaries from NASA bioscience publications
2. **Embed**: Converts text into vectors using Google’s `text-embedding-004`
3. **Store**: Saves embeddings in Convex with vector indexing
4. **Search & Answer**:
   - User asks a question
   - Query is embedded and matched to similar papers
   - Gemini 2.0 Flash generates a response using context
   - Citations are returned with the answer
